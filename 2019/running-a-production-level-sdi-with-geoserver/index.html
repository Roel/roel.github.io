  <h1>Running a production level SDI with Geoserver</h1>
  <h2>How we run a 99.5% uptime SDI at Databank Ondergrond Vlaanderen</h2>

  <p>At the 2019 FOSS4G-BE conference I gave a rather technical talk about how we went about setting up our <span
      title="Spatial Data Infrastructure">SDI</span> at Databank Ondergrond Vlaanderen. Our metadata and OGC services
    offered over 1600 layers at the time and served 2.5 million requests each week - and this has only increased since.
  </p>

  <p>In the talk I explained which components we use, from PostGIS databases, Minio S3 file storage to Geoserver and
    Geonetwork. I also discuss the various environments we have (development, <span title="Quality Assurance">QA</span>
    and production) and how our release and deploy procedures work. I also shed some light on our custom Geoserver
    build: this is not to move away from the official Geoserver project, but instead make it better while also allowing
    our fixes to hit production faster.</p>

  <p>Next up is the clustering: all our Geoserver endpoints are not single machines but clusters of multiple nodes. A
    loadbalancer distributes the load between the nodes, allowing us to scale to more users. I explain some lessons we
    learned while finding our the best clustering setup.</p>

  <p>A data publication infrastructure needs data (obviously) and this requires procedures too: not only the software
    needs to be tested and validated before it can hit production, so does the data that we publish. This is why we have
    two entirely separate Geoserver instances per environment: a work instance where the data is prepared and the
    services can be tested and a publication environment that is to be used by end users or integrators. The link
    between the two is made by a new Geoserver community module we developed. In Taskmanager you can describe your
    datapublication flows once, and then run them with a single click or even automatically. When all tests pass, this
    allows for easy data publication and updating, while keeping both instances separate.</p>

  <p>With data comes metadata: data about the data that describe its origins, quality, owner and contact person. Since
    we believe metadata to be best kept as close to the data as possible, we developed a new Geoserver community module
    for this too (meanwhile promoted to extension). The Metadata module adds a tab to each layer for you to fill in its
    metadata, with support for powerfull templating. The metadata is then published with the built-in CSW service of
    Geoserver, and will be automatically published together with the data itself using Taskmanager. In the end it is
    harvested by Geonetwork on a regular basis, so this is kept up-to-date automatically too.</p>
